# Assembly IA-32 and C Programs


This repository contains a few Assembly IA-32 programs as well as the equivalent C code snippets for those.

I created this repository to help me practice and stay in touch with my Assembly language logic like the short circuits that happen in the code during conditional statements.

Also, I plan on expanding this repository content by adding 64 bit Assembly for the same snippets if possible.
